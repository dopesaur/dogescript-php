# dogescript examples

In current directory, there's lots of examples of dogescript.

There are following examples of dogescript:

* `dogenacci.dge` - Factorial computation function (aka fibonacci) written in dogescript
* `helloworld.dge` - Simple script that outputs 'Hello, world!' in browser or terminal window

There's also compiled counter partners for every `.dge` file (with `.php` extensions). You can take a look at the result of dogescript-php compilation.
